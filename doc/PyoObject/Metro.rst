:class:`Metro` --- Regular ticks
================================

.. class:: Metro(time=1, poly=1)

    Parent class : :class:`PyoObject`

    Generate isochronous trigger signals.
    
    A trigger is an audio signal with a value of 1 surrounded by 0s.

    :param time: float or :class:`PyoObject`, optional
    
    Time between each trigger in seconds. Defaults to 1.

    :param poly: int, optional
    
    Metronome polyphony. Denotes how many independent streams are generated by
    the metronome, allowing overlapping processes. Available only at initialization.
    Defaults to 1.


.. method:: Metro.setTime(x)

    Replace the `time` attribute.

    :param x: float or :class:`PyoObject`


.. note::

    The out() method is bypassed. :class:`Metro`'s signal can't be sent to audio outs. 
    
    :class:`Metro` has no `mul` and `add` attributes.
    
.. attribute:: Metro.time

    float or :class:`PyoObject`. Time between each trigger in seconds.

**Example**

>>> s = Server().boot()
>>> s.start()
>>> m = Metro(time=.125).play()
>>> t = TrigRand(m, min=400, max=1000)
>>> a = Sine(freq=t, mul=.5).out()
