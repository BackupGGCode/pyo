To use pyo inside an OpenFrameworks project, first you need a 
working install of pyo on your system. After installing pyo,
you only need to copy these files in your project's sources:

from this folder:
- PyoClass.cpp
- PyoClass.h

from the folder "embedded":
- m_pyo.h

Make sure that your project includes flags for compiling and
linking against Python and that's it. You can use the class
"Pyo", defined in PyoClass.h and PyoClass.cpp.

On *nix system, you can set the Python flags with (in the file
config.make):

PROJECT_CFLAGS = `python-config --cflags` # compiler flags for Python
PROJECT_LDFLAGS = `python-config --ldflags` # linker flags for Python
