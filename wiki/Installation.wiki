=Dependencies=
To install pyo, you will need the following dependencies:
  * [http://www.python.org/download Python 2.6.x]
  * [http://www.portaudio.com portaudio]
  * [http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile libsndfile]

The easiest way to get portaudio and libsndfile is to install [http://csound.sourceforge.net/ csound], it will install those libraries for you.

=Compilation=
Once you have all the required dependencies, you can download pyo's source checking out the source code here:
{{{
svn checkout http://pyo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyo-read-only
}}}

In pyo's directory you then need to build the extension : 
{{{
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
}}}

If compilation went well you should see a pyo.so file in your pyo directory.
You can now test that it works by going in the python interpreter and doing the following :

{{{
python
>>> from start import *
>>> s.start()
}}}

This should play the first example, to stop it:
{{{
>>> s.stop()
}}}
