=Dependencies=
To install pyo, you will need the following dependencies:
  * [http://www.python.org/download Python 2.6.x]
  * [http://www.portaudio.com portaudio]
  * [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/portmedia/wiki/portmidi portmidi]
  * [http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile libsndfile]
  * [http://liblo.sourceforge.net/ liblo]


The easiest way to get portaudio, portmidi, libsndfile and liblo is to install [http://csound.sourceforge.net/ csound], it will install those libraries for you.

Please note that under Mac OS X you will need to install the developer tools to compile pyo.

Under 10.6 if compilation fails, you might want to try installing csound 5.10 instead of 5.11.  Also, setting your Python installation to 32 bits may help, to do so :

{{{
defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes
}}}

=Compilation=
Once you have all the required dependencies, you can download pyo's source checking out the source code here:
{{{
svn checkout http://pyo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyo-read-only
}}}

In pyo's directory you then need to build the extension : 
{{{
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
}}}

If compilation went well you should see a _pyo.so file in your pyo directory.
You can now test that it works by going in the python interpreter and doing the following :

{{{
python
>>> from start import *
>>> s.start()
}}}

This should play the first example, to stop it:
{{{
>>> s.stop()
}}}

=Building documentation=

Pyo documentation is created with [http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ Sphinx]. Sphinx can be installed with:

{{{
easy_install sphinx
}}}

To build the manual, run:
 
{{{
python setup.py --command-packages sphinx build_sphinx
}}}
